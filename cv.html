			<div class="mode">

				<p> 
					One of my favorites hoby is also fashion. I really like to watch fashion shows and discover how brilliants creatives directors could be. I often use the "Vogue Runway" app to see the last shows and I am also a big fan of Loic Prigent's work, who realise shorts documentarys about the world of fashion.

			<div class="travel">

				<p>
					Travelling is one of my passion, if I could spend my all life discovering all the countries of the world I would do it. One of my best travel was in Malaysia. I've been there for a month. It was a wonderfull travel. Also, I've been many times to Great Britain and I visited most of European countries. But it is just the beginning. I hope I'll continue to travel a lot in my future life.
